Hi Lauren

Great to hear that you want to work on Orka. Apologies for the state of the code. 
A lot of this was written designed for a specific machine in the labs. I will 
take some time this weekend (most likely 5th June) and tidy this.

Orka was intially deployed as a web app, but I am in the process of
dismantaling this. This is the reason the graphs menthioned in the paper do not
work. If you decide you want this source code, let either me or Anandha know
and I can set up another repository.

In order to run this, you need to download the Android linux SDK into the
dependencies folder (I believe I used android-22). You should not need any
extra libaries for running command line orka in it's current state.


To run the application:
run main.py <app_location> <monkey_script_location>

You also need to have created an Android emulator called n7.  

Orka dumps it's log file to stdout. This was fine when it was a web app but
does make the output a little tough to read now. Near the bottom of this you
will see an output like this: 

MAIN: methods is 1
MAIN: hardware is 4
[[{'routineName': 'showToast', 'calls': 1, 'Apis':
{'android.widget.Toast.show': 0.0005739758, 'android.widget.Toast.makeText':
0.007864691}}], {'Screen': 0.00109, 'total battery usage': 0.0233, 'Cell
standby': 0.000494, 'Process usage': 0.0218}]
Running process rm -rf /data/bjw114/working/*
Relative uses of energy on the NEXUS 7
the energy used by this programme could have instead run
the below activity for the shown time (in seconds)
Web browsing: 0.754900
HD Video: 0.838800
3D gaming: 0.335500

Orka used to pass as serialised version of the results to the web app, but the
newer system just dumps this into stdout. 


Apologies as there are numerous things that I am likely forgetting. Please feel
free to email me (ben.westfield@gmail.com) if you have questions/issues. If you
do email, please make sure you cc Anandha 

Thanks 

Ben
